 * Logging.h
 *
 *  Created on: Feb 8, 2016
 *      Author: iam
 *
 * Ian's simple logging (features added only on demand).
 * 
 * Note we are currently creating a logging object per LLVM pass.
 * 
 * Don't be surprised if you have to add a 
 * 
 *   friend Logging &operator << (Logging &logger, WeirdLLVMThing thing) {
 *     *(logger.raw_os) << thing;
 *     return logger;
 *   }
 * 
 * every now and then.
 * 
 * The logging gets used thusly:
 * 
 * 
 * #include "Logging.h"
 * 
 * int CrazyAssedPass::foo() {
 * 
 *     // Create object
 *     //
 *     //            location                optional destination
 *     //               V                          V
 *     Logging log ("CrazyAssedPass::foo()", "testfile.txt");
 * 
 *     // Writing warnings or errors to file is very easy and C++ style
 *     log << Logging::level::LOG_WARNING << "A warning (location gets added)";
 *     log << Logging::level::LOG_ERROR << "An error, also triggers adding location";
 *     log << "This is just a simple text, no location or level"; 
 * 
 *     return 0;
 * }
 *
