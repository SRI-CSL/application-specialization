[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SRI-CSL/OCCAM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SRI-CSL/OCCAM)


Prerequisites
============

[OCCAM](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/OCCAM) currently works fine on Linux, OS X, and FreeBSD.
It depends on an installation of LLVM. The master branch currently requires llvm-3.5, and
there are branches for llvm-3.8, and llvm-3.9. We will endeavor to maintain such
correspondences. You will also need the Google protobuffer compiler `protoc` and
the corresponding python [package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/protobuf/).

If you need to generate application bitcode,
you will want to install wllvm, either from the the pip [package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wllvm/) or the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/whole-program-llvm.git).

The test harness also requires [lit](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lit/) and `FileCheck`. `FileCheck` can often
be found in the binary directory of your llvm installation, however if you built your own, you may need to
read [this.](https://bugs.llvm.org//show_bug.cgi?id=25675)

Detailed configuration instructions for Ubuntu 14.04 can be gleaned from [bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/OCCAM/blob/master/vagrants/14.04/basic/bootstrap.sh)  as well as the Travis CI scripts for each branch [.travis.yml](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/OCCAM/blob/master/.travis.yml).

Building and Installing
=======================

Set where OCCAM's library will be stored:
```
  export OCCAM_HOME={path to location in your home directory}
```

Point to your LLVM's location, if non-standard:
```
  export LLVM_HOME=/usr/local/llvm-3.5
  export LLVM_CONFIG=llvm-config-3.5
```

Set where system libraries, including Google Protocol Buffers, are located:
```
  export LD_FLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib'
```

Build and install OCCAM with:

```
  make
  make install
  make test
```


Using OCCAM
===========

You can choose to record logs from the OCCAM
tool by setting the following variables:

```
  export OCCAM_LOGFILE={absolute path to log location}
  export OCCAM_LOGLEVEL={INFO, WARNING, or ERROR}
```


Using razor
===========

`razor` is a pip package that relies on the same dynamic library as `occam`,
so you should first build and install `occam` as described above. `razor`  provides
the commandline tool `slash`.
You can either install `razor` you can from this repository, or you can just do a
```
pip install razor
```
To install an editable version from this repository:

```
make -f Makefile develop
```

This may require sudo priviliges. Either way you can now use `slash`:

```
slash [--work-dir=<dir>]  [--force] [--no-strip] [--no-specialize] <manifest>
```

`slash` also accepts the following new command line option:
```
--no-specialize
```

which will prevent any inter-module specializations.


To function correctly `slash` calls LLVM tools such as `opt` and `clang++`. These should be available in
your `PATH`, and be the currently supported version (3.5). Like `wllvm`, `slash`, will pay attention to
the environment variables `LLVM_OPT_NAME` and `LLVM_CXX_NAME`
if your version of these tools are adorned with suffixes.


The Manifest(o)
===============

The manifest for `slash` should be valid JSON. The following keys
have meaning:

+ `main` : a path to the bitcode module containing the `main` entry point.

+ `modules`: a list of paths to the other bitcode modules needed.

+ `binary` : the name of the desired executable.

+ `native_libs` : a list of flags (`-lm`, `-lc`, `-lpthread`) or paths to native objects (`.o`, `.a`, `.so`, `.dylib`)

+ `ldflags`: a list of linker flags such as `--static`, `--nostdlib`

+ `args` : the list of arguments you wish to specialize in the main of `main`.


As an example, (see `examples/linux/apache`), to previrtualize apache:

```
{ "main" : "httpd.bc"
, "binary"  : "httpd_slashed"
, "modules"    : ["libapr-1.so.bc", "libaprutil-1.so.bc", "libpcre.so.bc"]
, "native_libs" : ["-lcrypt", "-ldl", "-lpthread"]
, "args"    : ["-d", "/var/www"]
, "name"    : "httpd"
}
```

Another example, (see `examples/linux/musl_nweb`), specializes `nweb` with `musl libc.c`:
```
{ "main" :  "nweb.o.bc"
, "binary"  : "nweb_razor"
, "modules"    : ["libc.a.bc"]
, "native_libs" : ["crt1.o", "libc.a"]
, "ldflags" : ["-static", "-nostdlib"]
, "args"    : ["8181", "./root"]
, "name"    : "nweb"
}
```
